#Trirong Font

The objective of this project is to create a formal Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface. Trirong is a low contrast typeface based on transitional serif. The main character set is quite strict and characterized by sharp and clear terminals and stiff junctions between stems and bowls. The family consists of 9 weights, ranging from Thin to Black with matching italics. For further development, this typeface can be extended the family to narrow and extended version, or matched with other non-Latin script.

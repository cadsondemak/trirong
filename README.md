#Trirong Font

Trirong means "tricolor" flag which also represents the flag of Thailand.

Trirong is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure as appeared in Thai traditional typeface.  It saves space and still preserves readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. This looped Thai and Transitional Serif Latin works well for formal usage.

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to  take into consideration because it might lead to  confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so it is not proper to extend to so many weights since it might make all the details look obscure.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.

Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

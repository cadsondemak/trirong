#Trirong Font

Trirong is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure as appeared in Thai traditional typeface.  It saves space and still preserves readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. This looped Thai and Transitional Serif Latin works well for formal usage.

Trirong means "tricolor" flag which also represents the flag of Thailand.

The Trirong project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/trirong
